\title{Simulations for Electrochemistry Experiments}
\description{
A collection of functions for simulating four different types of
electrochemistry experiments: two potential step experiments
(chronoamperometry and chronocoulometry) and two potential scan experiments
(linear-sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry). Each simulation allows
for either an oxidation reaction or for a reduction reaction, and allows for
a single following or a single preceding chemical reaction. Also included
are a variety of functions for displaying the result of a simulation in
either a static or animated format.
